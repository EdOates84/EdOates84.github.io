# Phase-3

In this phase, I worked more on the face recognition method. Because the problem is our face recognition algorithms do not give relevant results like some faces are almost similar, and face recognition algorithms misinterpret the anchors. So we have tried some solution so that we can get relevant results given below-

* By adjustment in epsilon 
* By adjustment in dimension

Both adjustments are mutually dependent, like decreasing dimension from 128D to 64D, 32D, 16D then we have to reduce epsilon; also, this is related to machine learning. For dimensional reduction purposes, I have to use PAC.
Then I'm preparing my code for final submission and put it on the HPC Cluster.
