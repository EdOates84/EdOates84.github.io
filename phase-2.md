### Updated on 16 July 2021

Frankie and I met on 16 July and discussed how to proceed because we are currently more than halfway through, So we mutually decided:


1. Integrate the results from the past two year's algorithm.
2. Write the final script, which will process all the videos that are present in the red hen's database.
3. Run the final script

This file is in the RedHenLab's Rosenthal dataset format:

filename: 2006-01-02_00001057_1-2_CNN_Newsroom_Rosemary_Church.txt

**2006-01-02** is the airing date

**1-2** means there are two shows segmented by algorithm, or this is the file of 1st show.

**CNN_Newsroom** is a show name.

**Rosemary_Church** is the anchor name of the whole show.

In the last second line, all the confident hosts are present.

In the last line, all the majority networks are present.
