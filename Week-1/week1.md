## Notes from the community bonding period

## Use of CRWU HPC

### Connection to HPC
* Red Hen Lab students are required to set up accounts on the Gallina HPC cluster at Case Western Reserve University since most projects must run on that server to be passed.
* We have to use the HPC cluster instead of our local servers. 
* To connect to the CRWU, you firstly should download the Forticlient vpn(This step is very important). 
* The website has already shown the details about how to use this vpn. Just notice that there are two passwords, the first one is the password you used to login in CASE, the second one is the DUO code.

This PDF contains some guidelines to access HPC server.
