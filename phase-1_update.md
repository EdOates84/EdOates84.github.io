In last week I mainly researched and explored the MediaWiki library. I have tried some different algorithms and getting the response. But I'm having trouble while using SPARQL, and I'm not able to use it. But most needed data I'm getting from the different implementation of MediaWiki.

So, The main problem is in the current algorithm; we are getting 10 to 15 anchors of a single show. Generally, that is not possible because we have mostly News related show it may contain 2, 3 anchors maximum.

In this meeting, I also want to talk about the image(face) processing so that we can get relevant faces, not the bunch of other faces, because the MediaWiki and the anchor information is the second thing we need to focus on anchor detection. After all, it is the nerve of our project.
