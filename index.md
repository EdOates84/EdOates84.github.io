## Introduction About Me 

My name is Nitesh Mahawar and I am a pre-final year student at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. I developed a passion for programming, and machine learning in particular in my freshman year and have been working with various technologies, languages, and frameworks since then. Iâ€™ve read and implemented a considerable number of research papers on Machine learning,
computer vision, and sequence/language modeling. I have worked on the same project in GSoC'20.
